1. understand the context 
* ID specific audience and what they need to know/do and determine data needed to illustrate case
  * Who: VP of Product, the primary decision maker in establishing
our product’s price.
  * What: Understand how competitors’ pricing has changed over
time and recommend a price range.
  * How: Show average retail price over time for Products A, B, C, D, and E.


2. choose an appropriate display
- given HOW, the variance in colors across the bars distract from this
- remember original headline and make appropriate iteration to highlight relevant data

* eliminate color

* highlight info relevant to Product C launch in 2010

* due to stairstep view that bars create somewhat artificially and trend over time usually represented with line graphs

* need to compare products across years at the same time

* now with this iteration, go back to purpose of visualization and see if it meets the need (understand how competitors’ prices have changed over time)
  
3. eliminate clutter

* De‐emphasize the chart title. It needs to be present, but doesn’t
need to attract as much attention as it does when written in bold
black.

• Remove chart border and gridlines, which take up space with-
out adding much value. Don’t let unnecessary elements distract
from your data!

• Push the x‐ and y‐axis lines and labels to the background by
making them grey. They shouldn’t compete visually with the data.
Modify the x‐axis tick marks so they align with the data points.

• Remove the variance in colors between the various lines.
We can use color more strategically, which we’ll discuss further
momentarily.

• Label the lines directly, eliminating the work of going back and
forth between the legend and the data to understand what is
being shown.

4. draw attention where you want it
* pre-attention attributes: highlight and tell different pieces of nuanced story

* after modifying headline to:

"After the launch of Product C in 2010, the average retail price of existing products declined."

<img width="533" alt="Screenshot 2025-01-16 at 10 18 32 AM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3dcb2a17-93b1-4ef7-8964-497c9e68d150" />

“With the launch of a new product in this space, it is typical to see an initial average retail price increase, followed by a decline.”

<img width="471" alt="Screenshot 2025-01-16 at 10 19 44 AM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/70dc6514-30f1-4cd0-89cc-3d02d6102576" />

“As of 2014, retail prices have converged across products, with an average retail price of $223, ranging from a low of $180 (Product C) to a high of $260 (Product A).”

<img width="466" alt="Screenshot 2025-01-16 at 10 20 07 AM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b537e734-ce67-4da1-9194-f079323e1e6b" />

5. think like a designer
* Form follows function: we chose a visual display (form) that will allow our audience to do what we need them to do (function) with ease

* Recommendations (what I would not necessarily do with headline and axis titles' alignment):

• Make the visual accessible with text. We can use simpler text in
the graph title and capitalize only the first word to make it easier
to comprehend and quicker to read. We also need to add axis
titles to both the vertical and horizontal axes.

• Align elements to improve aesthetics: The center alignment of
the graph title leaves it hanging in space and doesn’t align it with
any other elements; we should upper‐left‐most align the graph
title. 

• Align the y‐axis title vertically with the uppermost label and
the x‐axis title horizontally with the leftmost label. This creates
cleaner lines and ensures that your audience sees how to interpret what 
they are looking at before they get to the actual data.

6. tell a story   

* walk our audience through the story in the way that we want them to experience it

The progression:
  
 * structure
 * build chronological price path products followed
 * tenion in competitive landscape with Products: C, D and E launches
 * restored sense of balance when prices converged
 * end with call to action (CTA): recommendation for pricing our product

* knows what the audience wants to hear
* transport audience into world I describe
* vivid details, emotional honesty
* make the foreign feel familiar

1. ID key message/theme
2. build story around it with relatable characters, vivid details, clear structure
3. take audience on journey that enlightens, inspires, moves them in some way
